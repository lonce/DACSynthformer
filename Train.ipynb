    "A decoder-only transformer in pytorch to predict 'next output' at each time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time step t is represented by a vector of n=4 tokens from the Descript DAC encoder. \n",
    "The length of the sequence (context window) is Ti=86 for inference, and Tt=8*Ti for training. That is, the context window for training is 8 times the length of the context window for inference. \n",
    "The attention is \"causal\", looking only back in time, and the maximum look-back time for the attention blocks is Ti (even when the sequence is longer during training). That is, the masking matrix is *banded* - triangular to be causal, and limited in lookback which results in a diagonal band). This prevents much of the training on shortened context that happens when tokens are near the beginning of traning examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the vocabulary (the number of descrete values in each codebook) for each of the n tokens is V=1024. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataloader will as is usual, supply batches in triplets  (input, target, conditioning info) where the size of each input and output is Tt*n (the sequence length times the number of tokens at each time step). The tokens are indexes for the vocabulary in the range of (0, V-1). The targets are shifted relative to the input sequence by 1 as is typical for networks the learn to predict the output for the next time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer in the architecture will be a learnable \"multiembedding\" layer that embeds each of the 4 tokens at each time step as an m-dimensional vector. The n m-dimensional vectors are concatenated to provide the n*m dimensional input embeddings for the transformer blocks at each time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "A positional code is is added to the K and Q matricies in each Transformer block using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a stack of b transformer blocks that are standard (using layer norms, a relu for activation, and a forward expansion factor of 4 form the linear layer). Each transformer block consumes and produces a context window length sequence of m*n dimensional vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the last transformer block, there is a linear layer that maps the m*n dimensional vectors to the output size which is V*n (the vocabulary size time the number of tokens stacked at each time step). These are the logits that will be fed to the softmax functions (one for each of the n to kens) that provide the probability distribtion across the vocabulary set. We use the criterion nn.CrossEntropyLoss() for computing the loss using the targets provided by the dataloader, and Adam for the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, at inference time, the fixed-length context window is shorter than the training sequence window length, and equal to the maximum look-back time of the attention blocks. The inference process takes the output produced at each time step (a stack of n tokens), and shift them in to a sliding window that is used for input for the next time step. The length of the sequences generated during inference is arbitrary and should be settable with a parameter. \n"
